🌍 Safe Route Kenya

A Flask-powered safety-rating app that helps users compare neighborhoods in Kenya using a simple, fast, lightweight backend.


---

📌 Overview

Safe Route Kenya is a Python + Flask web application that provides quick safety insights for Kenyan neighborhoods. Users can select a location and instantly view its risk score based on simulated crime, lighting, visibility, and public-presence data. The project demonstrates backend logic, API-style routing, JSON responses, and dynamic UI updates — all built to highlight problem-solving and real-world application design.

This project was created to strengthen my skills in Python, Flask, backend development, JSON handling, UI integration, and web deployment using GitHub Codespaces.
